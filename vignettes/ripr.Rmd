# About

This vignette describes an analysis of Repeat Induced Point (RIP)
mutations in R using the `ripr` package. `ripr` contains functionality
for parsing RepeatMasker output, calculating RIP scores, and plotting
scores along chromosomes in Manhattan-like plots. Before we start with
the example analysis, we describe how `ripr` represents RepeatMasker
output.

## R setup

```{r knitr-setup, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,
                      fig.width=8, fig.height=6, autodep=TRUE,
                      cache=TRUE, include=TRUE, eval=TRUE, tidy=FALSE,
                      cache.extra=packageVersion('tufte'), dev=c('png'))
knitr::knit_hooks$set(inline = function(x) {
  prettyNum(x, big.mark=" ")
})
```


```{r r-setup}
library(ripr)
library(ggplot2)
library(viridis)
library(plyr)
```

## On object representation of RepeatMasker output

RepeatMasker screens sequences for repeats and low-complexity regions.
`ripr` contains functions to parse two of RepeatMasker's output files,
namely the annotation and alignment results. These files pair
coordinates in the input sequence that is scanned for repeats (here,
the genome sequence) with coordinates in the repeat sequence that is
defined in the RepeatMasker library. The input sequence will
henceforth be referred to as the *query* and the repeat sequence the
*subject*.

`ripr` stores the results from RepeatMasker output as an
`AlignmentPairs` object, which is a subclass of the Bioconductor class
`S4Vectors::Pairs`. A `Pairs` object aligns two vectors along slot
names `first` and `second`, and the `AlignmentPairs` object adds extra
slots related to RepeatMasker output. In the following sections we
parse RepeatMasker output and explain the additional slot names.

For more information about RepeatMasker and its output formats, see
[@repeatmasker_docs].


### Annotation output

The RepeatMasker annotation output is a simple tabular format where
each line consists of a query-subject pair and additional statistics
such as score and percentage divergence:

<div style="font-size:xx-small">
``` {r head-annotation-file, comment=NA, echo=FALSE}
cat(system(paste("head -5  ", system.file("extdata", "crassa_lg2.fasta.out", package="ripr")), intern=TRUE), sep="\n")
```
</div>

The annotation files are parsed with the function
`readRepeatMaskerAnnotation`. Each line is converted to an entry in an
`AlignmentPairs` object. `AlignmentPairs` has slot names `score`,
`divergence`, `deletions` and `insertions` corresponding to the first
four columns above, and a slot `linkage_id` corresponding to the last
column. There are also two slots `query` and `subject` that correspond
to the query and subject columns. However, for compactness and ease of
management, these slots are populated by
`GenomicRanges::GRanges`-derived objects `ripr::AlignmentItem` and
`ripr::RepeatAlignmentItem`. We parse the an example file and show the
resulting output:

```{r read-annotation-file, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ap <- readRepeatMaskerAnnotation(system.file("extdata", "crassa_lg2.fasta.out",
                                 package="ripr"))
head(ap, 2)
```

The `query` and `subject` slots can be accessed with the `query`
and `sbjct` accessor functions:

```{r alignmentpairs-accessors}
qry <- query(ap)
sbj <- sbjct(ap)
```

The query object consists of ranges on the genome where RepeatMasker
has identified repeats:

```{r query-alignmentitem}
head(qry, 2)
```

`AlignmentItem` extends `GenomicRanges::GRanges` by adding a slot
`bases` that stores the *no. of bases in query sequence past the
ending position of match* [see @repeatmasker_docs, section How to read
the results]. There is also an additional slot `sequence` that can
store the actual sequence of the matching region.


The subject is a `RepeatAlignmentItem` object, where the only
difference compared to `AlignmentItem` is that it has an extra slot
`repeat_class` that stores information about the repeat class, as
defined by RepeatMasker:

```{r subject-repeatalignmentitem}
head(sbj, 2)
```

### Alignment output

The alignment output contains information similar to that in the
annotation output, but as the names implies also includes alignments:

<div style="font-size:small">
``` {r head-alignment-file, comment=NA, echo=FALSE}
alnfile <- system.file("extdata", "crassa_lg2.fasta.cat.gz", package="ripr")
p1 <- system(paste("zcat ", alnfile, " | head -10"), intern=TRUE)
p2 <- system(paste("zcat ", alnfile, " | head -34 | tail -8"), intern=TRUE)
cat(c(p1, "  ...", " ", p2), sep="\n")
```
</div>

RepeatMasker alignment files are parsed with the function
`readRepeatMaskerAlignment`.

```{r read-alignment, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
aln <- readRepeatMaskerAlignment(system.file("extdata", "crassa_lg2.fasta.cat.gz",
                                 package="ripr"))
```

As when reading annotation files, the result is an `AlignmentPairs`
object. Looking at the query, we now see that the `sequence` slot is
populated with the aligned sequence, including gaps:

```{r get-alignment-query}
alnqry <- query(aln)
head(alnqry, 2)
```

It is important to note however, that the annotation and alignment
files are **not** equivalent, as the RepeatMasker documentation
clearly states [@repeatmasker_docs, section Discrepancies between
alignments and annotation]:

	Most discrepancies between alignments and annotation result from
	adjustments made to produce more legible annotation. This annotation
	also tends to be closer to the biological reality than the raw
	cross_match output. For example, adjustments often are necessary when
	a repeat is fragmented through deletions, insertions, or an inversion.
	Many subfamilies of repeats closely resemble each other, and when a
	repeat is fragmented these fragments can be assigned different
	subfamily names in the raw output. The program often can decide if
	fragments are derived from the same integrated transposable element
	and which subfamily name is appropriate (subsequently given to all
	fragments). This can result in discrepancies in the repeat name and
	matching positions in the consensus sequence (subfamily consensus
	sequences differ in length).

The analyses described in this vignette are all based on the
annotation files, and no further mention will be made of the alignment
output.


# The input data

The data consists of chromosome 2 sequence files and repeatmasker
results for three *Neurospora* species:

| Species         | Chromosome name  | Sequence file    | Annotation           | Alignment               |
|-----------------|------------------|------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| *N.crassa*      | Supercontig_12.2 | crassa_lg2.fasta | crassa_lg2.fasta.out | crassa_lg2.fasta.cat.gz |
| *N.sitophila*   | 5940pb_lg2       | 5940pb_lg2.fasta | 5940pb_lg2.fasta.out | 5940pb_lg2.fasta.cat.gz |
| *N.tetrasperma* | 9046pb_lg2       | 9046pb_lg2.fasta | 9046pb_lg2.fasta.out | 9046pb_lg2.fasta.cat.gz |


We define genome and annotation files for loading:

```{r loading-data}
genome.names <- c("5940pb_lg2", "9046pb_lg2", "crassa_lg2")
genome.files <- system.file("extdata", paste0(genome.names, ".fasta"),
							package="ripr")
names(genome.files) <- genome.names
rm.annot.files <- system.file("extdata", paste0(genome.names, ".fasta.out"),
							  package="ripr")
names(rm.annot.files) <- genome.names
```

Genome files are loaded with `Biostrings::readDNAStringSet`

```{r genome-files}
genomes <- lapply(genome.files, Biostrings::readDNAStringSet)
```

and annotations files with `readRepeatMaskerAnnotation`. We also add
the genome name as a metadata attribute for later access.


```{r load-annotation-files, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
rm.annot.ap <- AlignmentPairsList(
    lapply(names(rm.annot.files), function(x) {
        ap <- readRepeatMaskerAnnotation(rm.annot.files[[x]])
        metadata(ap)$genome <- x
        ap
    }))
names(rm.annot.ap) <- names(rm.annot.files)
rm.annot.ap
```

The loading of files was wrapped in a call to `AlignmentPairsList`
which is a list container for `AlignmentPairs` objects, modelled after
`GenomicRanges::GRangesList`.


## Adjustment of repeat classes

Before proceeding, we look at the repeat classes for all the results.

```{r investigate-repeat-names}
repeats <- unique(unlist(lapply(rm.annot.ap, function(x) {levels(repeatClass(sbjct(x)))})))
repeats
```

We simplify the names and rename levels with `plyr::mapvalues`.

```{r repeat-mapvalues, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
repeats.new <- unlist(lapply(strsplit(repeats, "/"), function(x) {gsub("\\?$", "", x[[1]])}))
rm.annot.ap <- endoapply(rm.annot.ap, function(x) {
    sbj <- sbjct(x)
    repeatClass(sbj) <- mapvalues(repeatClass(sbj), from=repeats, to=repeats.new)
    sbjct(x) <- sbj
    x
})
```

# RIP index calculation on TE elements

The `ripr` package defines three different RIP metrics:

- **RIP product index:** TA/AT ratio [@margolin_methylated_1998; @@selker_methylated_2003]
    -   not RIP < 0.8
    -   RIP > 1.1
- **RIP substrate index:** (CA + TG) / (AC + GT) ratio  [@margolin_methylated_1998; @@selker_methylated_2003]
    -   not RIP > 1.1
    -   RIP < 0.9
- **RIP composite index:** RIP product index - RIP substrate index [@lewis_relics_2009]
    -   RIP: positive value

In order to calculate the RIP scores, we need the genome subsequences
that are defined by the query coordinates in each AlignmentPairs
object. The `calculateRIP` function takes as input an `AlignmentPairs`
object, and a genome represented by a `Biostrings::DNAStringSet`
object. Since we loaded the genomes before, we can proceed to
calculate the RIP scores:

```{r calculate-rip}
rip.ls <- endoapply(rm.annot.ap, function(x){
    calculateRIP(x, genomes[[metadata(x)$genome]])
})
```

## RIP index as a function of repeat width

To begin with we investigate the effect of repeat width on the RIP
composite index score. Typically, signatures of RIP (score > 0) are
visible first at 400bp (REF: rephrase). We plot the RIP composite
index versus query width and note that ripped sequences indeed are
longer.

```{r plot-rip, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
rip.df <- do.call("rbind", lapply(rip.ls, as.data.frame, metadata=TRUE))
ggplot(rip.df, aes(y=rip.composite, x=query.width)) + geom_point(size=1) + ylim(-3, 3) + facet_wrap(. ~ genome)
```

## Comparing RIP index to a null distribution

Even though there seem to be a large number of repeats that are
ripped, we would like to compare
