	abstract = {Background
Genomic duplications constitute major events in the evolution of species, allowing paralogous copies of genes to take on fine-tuned biological roles. Unambiguously identifying the orthology relationship between copies across multiple genomes can be resolved by synteny, i.e. the conserved order of genomic sequences. However, a comprehensive analysis of duplication events and their contributions to evolution would require all-to-all genome alignments, which increases at N2 with the number of available genomes, N.

Results
Here, we introduce Kraken, software that omits the all-to-all requirement by recursively traversing a graph of pairwise alignments and dynamically re-computing orthology. Kraken scales linearly with the number of targeted genomes, N, which allows for including large numbers of genomes in analyses. We first evaluated the method on the set of 12 Drosophila genomes, finding that orthologous correspondence computed indirectly through a graph of multiple synteny maps comes at minimal cost in terms of sensitivity, but reduces overall computational runtime by an order of magnitude. We then used the method on three well-annotated mammalian genomes, human, mouse, and rat, and show that up to 93\% of protein coding transcripts have unambiguous pairwise orthologous relationships across the genomes. On a nucleotide level, 70 to 83\% of exons match exactly at both splice junctions, and up to 97\% on at least one junction. We last applied Kraken to an RNA-sequencing dataset from multiple vertebrates and diverse tissues, where we confirmed that brain-specific gene family members, i.e. one-to-many or many-to-many homologs, are more highly correlated across species than single-copy (i.e. one-to-one homologous) genes. Not limited to protein coding genes, Kraken also identifies thousands of newly identified transcribed loci, likely non-coding RNAs that are consistently transcribed in human, chimpanzee and gorilla, and maintain significant correlation of expression levels across species.

Conclusions
Kraken is a computational genome coordinate translator that facilitates cross-species comparisons, distinguishes orthologs from paralogs, and does not require costly all-to-all whole genome mappings. Kraken is freely available under LPGL from http://github.com/nedaz/kraken.},

	abstract = {The large diversity of mating systems observed in the fungal kingdom underlines the importance of mating system change in fungal evolution. The selfing species Neurospora tetrasperma has evolved a novel method of achieving self-fertility by a mating system referred to as pseudohomothallism. However, little is known about the origin of N. tetrasperma and its relationship to the self-sterile, heterothallic, Neurospora species. In this study, we used a combination of phylogenetic and population genetic analyses to reconstruct the evolutionary history of N. tetrasperma and its heterothallic relatives. We sequenced 9 unlinked nuclear loci from 106 strains of N. tetrasperma sampled from across the globe, and a sample of 28 heterothallic strains of Neurospora. Our analyses provide strong support for monophyly of N. tetrasperma, but reject the monophyly of N. crassa. We estimate that N. tetrasperma is of a recent origin and that it diverged from the heterothallic species ∼1 million years ago. We also extend previous findings on the diversification within the N. tetrasperma clade, with 10 lineages identified. Taken together, these findings indicate that N. tetrasperma is younger than has been previously reported and that a rapid diversification of lineages has occurred within the N. tetrasperma clade.},

In mammals, methylation is almost exclusively in the under-represented CpG dinucleotides, and most CpGs are methylated1 whereas in Neurospora, methylation is not preferentially in CpG dinucleotides and the bulk of the genome is unmethylated4. DNA methylation is essential in mammals5 but is dispensable in Neurospora3,6, making this simple eukaryote a favoured organism in which to study methylation. Recent studies indicate that DNA methylation in Neurospora depends on one DNA methyltransferase, DIM-2 (ref. 6), directed by a histone H3 methyltransferase, DIM-5 (ref. 7), but little is known about its cellular and evolutionary functions. As only four methylated sequences have been reported previously in N. crassa, we used methyl-binding-domain agarose chromatography8 to isolate the methylated component of the genome. DNA sequence analysis shows that the methylated component of the genome consists almost exclusively of relics of transposons that were subject to repeat-induced point mutation—a genome defence system that mutates duplicated sequences9.},

We characterized the Ψ63 region to better understand the control and function of DNA methylation. The 120-bp 5S rRNA-like region of Ψ63 is interrupted by a 1.9-kb insertion that has characteristics of sequences that have been modified by repeat-induced point mutation (RIP). We found sequences related to this insertion in wild-type strains of N. crassa and other Neurospora species. Most showed evidence of RIP; but one, isolated from the N. crassa host of Ψ63, showed no evidence of RIP. A deletion from near the center of this sequence apparently rendered it incapable of participating in RIP with the related full-length copies. The Ψ63 insertion and the related sequences have features of transposons and are related to the Fot1 class of fungal transposable elements. Apparently Ψ63 was generated by insertion of a previously unrecognized Neurospora transposable element into a 5S rRNA gene, followed by RIP. We name the resulting inactivated Neurospora transposon PuntRIP1 and the related sequence showing no evidence of RIP, but harboring a deletion that presumably rendered it defective for transposition, dPunt.},

	abstract = {Both RNAi-dependent and -independent mechanisms have been implicated in the establishment of heterochromatin domains, which may be stabilized by feedback loops involving chromatin proteins and modifications of histones and DNA. Neurospora crassa sports features of heterochromatin found in higher eukaryotes, namely cytosine methylation (5mC), methylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me), and heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), and is a model to investigate heterochromatin establishment and maintenance. We mapped the distribution of HP1, 5mC, H3K9me3, and H3K4me2 at 100 bp resolution and explored their interplay. HP1, H3K9me3, and 5mC were extensively co-localized and defined 44 heterochromatic domains on linkage group VII, all relics of repeat-induced point mutation. Interestingly, the centromere was found in an approximately 350 kb heterochromatic domain with no detectable H3K4me2. 5mC was not found in genes, in contrast to the situation in plants and animals. H3K9me3 is required for HP1 localization and DNA methylation in N. crassa. In contrast, we found that localization of H3K9me3 was independent of 5mC or HP1 at virtually all heterochromatin regions. In addition, we observed complete restoration of DNA methylation patterns after depletion and reintroduction of the H3K9 methylation machinery. These data show that A:T-rich RIP'd DNA efficiently directs methylation of H3K9, which in turn, directs methylation of associated cytosines.},

	abstract = {We describe two unusual 5S RNA regions from Neurospora crassa that are tightly linked. Sequence analysis suggests that these genes or pseudogenes, which we designate zeta (zeta) and eta (eta), arose by a 794-base-pair tandem duplication followed by hundreds of exclusively cytosine to thymine mutations. The duplication was most likely generated by nonhomologous recombination involving a DNA segment having a striking purine-pyrimidine strand asymmetry. Restriction analysis of genomic DNA from tissue grown in the presence or absence of 5-azacytidine indicates that many, and perhaps all, cytosines in the duplicated region are methylated in most cells. This is in contrast to the situation typically observed in eukaryotes, where 5-methylcytosine is found only at positions one or two nucleotides preceding guanine residues. No DNA methylation was detected in the unique DNA flanking the zeta-eta duplication. Thus the "signal" for methylation may be the duplication itself. The numerous transition mutations in this region probably occurred by deamination of 5-methylcytosines. Our results suggest that DNA methylation can have important evolutionary consequences in eukaryotes.},
